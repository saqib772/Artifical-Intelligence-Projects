There are a lot of applications where websites collect data from their users and use that data to predict the likes and dislikes of their users. This allows them to recommend the content that they like. Recommender systems are a way of suggesting or similar items and ideas to a userâ€™s specific way of thinking.

Recommender System is different types:
- *Collaborative Filtering:* Collaborative Filtering recommends items based on similarity measures between users and/or items. The basic assumption behind the algorithm is that users with similar interests have common preferences.

- *Content-Based Recommendation*: It is supervised machine learning used to induce a classifier to discriminate between interesting and uninteresting items for the user.

Content-Based Recommendation System: Content-Based systems recommends items to the customer similar to previously high-rated items by the customer. It uses the features and properties of the item. From these properties, it can calculate the similarity between the items.

In a content-based recommendation system, first, we need to create a profile for each item, which represents the properties of those items. From the user profiles are inferred for a particular user. We use these user profiles to recommend the items to the users from the catalog.
