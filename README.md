### ðŸ”¥Artificial Intelligence ProjectsðŸ”¥

This repository contains a collection of my projects on artificial intelligence. The projects are divided into the following categories:

- Natural language processing: This category includes projects that use natural language processing techniques to solve problems. For example, there is a project that uses machine learning to classify text into different categories.

- Computer vision: This category includes projects that use computer vision techniques to solve problems. For example, there is a project that uses object detection to identify objects in images.

- Machine learning: This category includes projects that use machine learning techniques to solve problems. For example, there is a project that uses regression to predict the price of a house.

Each project has its own README file that provides more information about the project.

## Getting Started
To get started with this repository, you will need to have the following installed:

- Python
- The relevant libraries for the projects you want to work on

Once you have these installed, you can clone the repository to your local machine. Then, you can open the README file for each project to learn more about it and how to run it.

## Contributing
I welcome contributions to this repository. If you have a project that you think would be a good fit, please open a pull request.
