### Python Project â€“ Music Genre Classification

In this Project we are going to develop a deep learning project to automatically classify different musical genres from audio files. We will classify these audio files using their low-level features of frequency and time domain.

For this project we need a dataset of audio tracks having similar size and similar frequency range. GTZAN genre classification dataset is the most recommended dataset for the music genre classification project and it was collected for this task only.



About the dataset:
The GTZAN genre collection dataset was collected in 2000-2001. It consists of 1000 audio files each having 30 seconds duration. There are 10 classes ( 10 music genres) each containing 100 audio tracks. Each track is in .wav format. It contains audio files of the following 10 genres:
